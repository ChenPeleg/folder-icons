Based on the information from the Material Theme folder associations, I can suggest several folder associations that would be relevant for AI-related markdown files and context in your project. The website lists various folder icons and their associated naming patterns.

For your AI-related markdown files and context, here are some suggestions:

AI/Machine Learning Folders:

Although there's no specific "AI" folder association in the Material Theme, you could use folders like:
models/ - For AI models documentation
data/ - For training data documentation
algorithms/ - For AI algorithm documentation
Documentation-related Folders:

docs/ - General documentation (has a specific folder icon)
markdown/ - For markdown-specific files (has a dedicated icon)
wiki/ - For wiki-style documentation
Context/Knowledge folders:

knowledge/ - For knowledge base files
context/ - For context-related information
resources/ - For general AI resources
Other Relevant Folders:

research/ - For AI research documentation
examples/ - For example use cases
tutorials/ - For AI tutorials
notes/ - For general notes
Looking at your current workspace structure, you have:

thoughts/
work-process/
You could potentially reorganize or add folders like:

ai-knowledge/ - For AI-specific knowledge
context-docs/ - For context documentation
models/ - For model documentation
research-notes/ - For research findings
