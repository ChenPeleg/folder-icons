# Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized modeling language used to visualize the design of a system. It provides a set of graphical notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software systems. Here are some key UML diagram types:  
1. **Class Diagram**: Shows the static structure of a system, including classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships.
2. **Use Case Diagram**: Represents the functional requirements of a system, showing actors and their interactions with use cases.
3. **Sequence Diagram**: Illustrates how objects interact in a particular sequence of time.
4. **Activity Diagram**: Depicts the flow of activities or actions in a system.
5. **State Diagram**: Describes the states of an object and transitions between those states.
6. **Component Diagram**: Shows the organization and dependencies among a set of components.
7. **Deployment Diagram**: Represents the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.
